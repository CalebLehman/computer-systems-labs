# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective - Labs

My "write-ups"/work/solutions for the self-study labs provided on the
[book website](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/labs.html).
Each completed lab is in a sub-directory containing
  * a `handout` directory with the lab materials and description
  * a `solution` directory with miscellaneous descriptions and scripts
    constituting my solutions
